# Skipper (beta)

![Header Graphic](/public/assets/skipper-header-graphic.png)

Skipper can work with you how you want. Want to interact with your voice? You can. Need Skipper to see something? Give it an image! Simply want text chat? That works too. Want to chat with OpenAI's GPT-4? Or Google's Gemini Pro? Or, want to chat with a model that runs locally on your device? You can do that too. Skipper is designed to be flexible and work with you.

## Get Started

Getting started with Skipper is easy. The hardest part is grabbing an API key for one of our cloud based models before you start.

Note that to start using Skipper, you must enter your API key for atleast one of our cloud based models (know that if you dont add a Google API key for example, you will not be able to use the Google Gemini model). The app will givey you two inputs to enter your keys upon the first launch of the app. Skipper will use these API keys to chat with these individual models. Note that this will cost money on, for example, your OpenAI account, although the cost is minimal. This also gives you the upside of having full control of your cloud model usage. Please note that your API key does not get stored in any way in the cloud through Skipper. Your keys are only stored locally on your device.
